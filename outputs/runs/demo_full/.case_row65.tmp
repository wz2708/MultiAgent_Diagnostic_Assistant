Nail pitting in psoriasis is caused by defective keratinization of the nail matrix leading to small depressions on the nail surface, and this is characteristic and distinct from other nail diseases such as fungal infections or eczema, which rarely show this pattern. The reported inflamed nails along with nail pitting align well with psoriatic nail involvement, supporting the diagnosis.","A2: Sleep disturbance in this patient directly correlates with the severity of the rash and the associated itchiness and pain.
