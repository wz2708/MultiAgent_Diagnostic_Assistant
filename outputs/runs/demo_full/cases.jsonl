He described his symptoms: back pain, trouble breathing, weakness in arms and legs, vertigo, balance problems, and neck pain. I have suggested arthritis as the candidate diagnosis and the medical student has asked three critical questions, particularly about how arthritis explains trouble breathing and vertigo/balance problems, as well as back pain. I will now formulate concise, evidence-informed answers based on the memory content about arthritis and the patient's symptoms, adjusting confidence if needed. The evidence from the historical retrieval (History RAG) strongly supports arthritis as accounting for neck pain, muscle weakness, joint swelling, stiffness, and walking discomfort. The knowledge retrieval (Knowledge RAG) confirms that degenerative arthritis typically causes back pain. But there is little or no evidence linking arthritis directly to trouble breathing or vertigo/balance problems. Thus, I will respond to each question referencing this evidence and admit lack of evidence for some, and then adjust confidence downward slightly since some symptoms are unexplained.
